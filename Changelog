Key:
* An internal code change that shouldn't affect most people
** An optional feature has been added that is probably worth checking out
*** This is a new feature that will likely require a change in your code

Changes since 0.55
------------------

** Updates to the documentation

** Updates to comments

** Now exporting the xml2hash function


Changes since 0.54
------------------

** Moved OpenThought::XML2Hash into it's own package.  It's flexible enough
that others may wish to make use of it.  However, it may not process enough
of the XML spec in order to warrant putting it into the XML namespace.
