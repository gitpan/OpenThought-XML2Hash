Key:
* An internal code change that shouldn't affect most people
** An optional feature has been added that is probably worth checking out
*** This is a new feature that will likely require a change in your code


Changes since 0.56
------------------

** Passing an element parameter should now work as documented

** Nasty escaping bug fixed.  Data containing < > & chars would probably not
have worked as expected.

* Sometimes, XML::Parser::Expat can call the character handler multiple times,
even before reaching an end tag.  We now properly handle this case by
concatenating the strings into one, as opposed to making it an array.


Changes since 0.55
------------------

** Updates to the documentation

** Updates to comments

** Now exporting the xml2hash function


Changes since 0.54
------------------

** Moved OpenThought::XML2Hash into it's own package.  It's flexible enough
that others may wish to make use of it.  However, it may not process enough
of the XML spec in order to warrant putting it into the XML namespace.
