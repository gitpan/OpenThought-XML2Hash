=head1 NAME

OpenThought::XML2Hash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use OpenThought::XML2Hash;

my $xml = '<xml><packet type="example"/></xml>';
my $hash = xml2hash( $xml );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenThought::XML2Hash is a no nonsense XML parser.  It's an attempt to create a
hash out of an XML packet as fast as possible.  It takes an XML file or string
and returns a hash of the appropriate nested depth based on the contents of the
XML.

XML2Hash only looks at XML attributes, start tags, end tags, and the
character data in between.  It ignores most everything else, including comments,
namespaces, and CDATA sections.  This is a feature :-)  One day, it'll probably
do something constructive with comments.

With the limited set of XML processed, and the methods used to process it,
XML2Hash appears to be almost twice as fast as similar solutions found on CPAN.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

use strict;
use XML::Parser::Expat();
require Exporter;

@OpenThought::XML2Hash::ISA       = qw( Exporter );
@OpenThought::XML2Hash::EXPORT_OK = qw( xml2hash );

=head2 hashref xml2hash( xml, [element] )

This is the main function of the XML2Hash package.  It accepts two arguments,
only the first is required.  It then returns the hash representation of your
data.

=over

=item Parameters

=over

=item xml

Path to the XML file, or a string containing an XML packet.

=item element (optional)

Don't process the XML data until reaching this element.  If you specify element
"foo" here, foo will not be used as a hash key, but the next XML tag to be
found will be.  It makes sense when you use it :-)

This would typically be used when you have a large XML file, but you only need
a small subsection as a hash.  By passing in the b<element> argument, you'd
save some CPU time by only processing the data you care about.

=back

=item Returns

=over

Returns a reference to a hash containing the contents of the XML file, with
each XML element being a hash key.  The hash is nested just as your XML was.
